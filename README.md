## Advent of Code Solutions

### Automation

This has been streamlined by using the advent-of-code-data library for speed.

This is done so I can fetch problem input and description without manually touching the website.

Additionally, I can grab the input directly and feed it into the solution file.

To my knowledge, the advent-of-code-data library does follow the rules of automation for the AoC website. No other automation is done outside of that.
